We've removed it.\r\n\r\n## üêõ shared car bug\r\n\r\nIn short, we were greatly overestimating the footprint of car-sharing.\r\n\r\nWe now attribute a share of the vehicle's construction to each person who rents a car to get around. We used to make the mistake of attributing *all* the construction to him. \r\n",

The others are coming soon!\r\n\r\n## Brand-new figures for the food footprint\r\n\r\nWe've improved the footprints for lunch and dinner dishes. \r\n\r\nFirstly, we've improved the calculation of the emission factor for the most important component of meals, meat and fish. Rather than a simple average, we now calculate an average weighted by national consumption (for example, for the \"meat 1\" dish, pork and chicken are no longer equally important). \r\n\r\nSecondly, in October there was a global update of agribalyse, which corrected some overestimated emission factors. We have updated our figures accordingly. \r\n\r\n For <a href=\"https://github.com/datagir/nosgestesclimat/pull/1525\">further information</a>.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://nosgestesclimat.fr/documentation/alimentation/plats/viande-1\">![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1177762/200906087-5748cab9-d053-48dd-b169-3038dcf50fa2.png)</a>\r\n\r\n\r\n## Improved navigation during and after the test\r\n\r\nIt's <a href=\"https://github.com/datagir/nosgestesclimat-site/pull/677\">now easier</a> to navigate through categories and answers already given after the test. \r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1177762/193876373-fd942951-afb3-40ec-8316-480b9bdf7241.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1177762/193876420-5203196f-54af-42fb-b61b-9e2822da9a59.png)\r\n\r\nIn the same vein, a new button `Find my simulation` has been added to the home page, and the progress of the test in % on the profile page. For further <a href=\"https://github.com/datagir/nosgestesclimat-site/pull/672\">information</a>.\r\n\r\n## A new page to explain our fossil fuel dependency\r\n\r\nA <a href=\"https://nosgestesclimat.fr/p√©trole-et-gaz\">new page</a> to explain what's at stake in reducing our consumption of oil and gas. After all, climate is just one of them, and we're going through a period where inflation and geopolitical tensions are more and more part of the equation.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1177762/200906228-cb2db1ba-3083-48eb-9a96-26f0fb02daf1.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

We've completely redesigned it, bringing it closer to a mini-game where the objective is to reduce your footprint. \r\n\r\n![ngc-action-2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1177762/139829768-5759d428-1e0d-4c7d-9fd3-682dbebb1b90.gif)\r\n\r\nThis is just the beginning: we've already planned the <a href=\"https://github.com/datagir/nosgestesclimat-site/issues/359\">next steps</a> to make it even easier to get involved.\r\n\r\nWe're also introducing *personas*: typical profiles that you can select to experience the action course as a given citizen. \r\n\r\n## The menu üêüÔ∏è\r\n\r\nWe've received dozens of requests to integrate a fish menu on the diet choice screen. There are now 2! \r\n\r\n![Capture d‚Äô√©cran du 2021-11-02 11-29-03](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1177762/139830102-bd7cee54-c1fd-454c-8eb0-7ce2a750ffa8.png)\r\n\r\nThese new dishes have been created using the <a href=\"https://agribalyse.fr/\">Agribalyse</a> database, and the calculation is of course *open*. We'll be bringing you lots more food news in the near future. \r\n\r\n## A new menu for the application \r\n\r\nNosgestesclimat is designed to be used on both mobile and desktop devices. The mobile version now has a permanent menu at the bottom of the screen, and the desktop version a new two-column layout, with a menu also on the left. \r\n\r\n![Capture d‚Äô√©cran du 2021-11-02 11-31-33](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1177762/139830463-203c8896-0eda-49ad-ba45-be1a19e180de.png)\r\n\r\nThis new menu makes the application more accessible, and it's just one of many accessibility improvements we have <a href=\"https://github.com/datagir/nosgestesclimat-site/issues/350\">planned</a>.\r\n\r\n## French average rises to 9 tons! \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, this does not reflect any unexpected efforts, but an improvement in the Ministry of the Environment's calculation method. \r\n\r\nThe good news is that the French administration is taking the matter seriously, improving its calculations and explaining the differences scientifically. \r\n\r\nDetailed explanations <a href=\"https://twitter.com/maeool/status/1453282887583866885\">here</a>.\r\n\r\nSo why do we show an average of 9.8 tonnes in the simulator? Because our calculation is based on a different, complementary method to that used by the government. Find out more <a href=\"https://github.com/datagir/nosgestesclimat-site/issues/365#issuecomment-957321261\">here</a>.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Conference mode improvements üèüÔ∏è\r\n\r\nThis collective mode of using ourgestesclimat is increasingly popular. To make it easier to share the link at the start of the conference, we've generated a super QRCode that you just have to project or send by e-mail\r\n![Capture d‚Äô√©cran du 2021-11-02 11-32-27](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1177762/139830597-63fe1856-5622-4c52-b7f4-23ccbfaa6bd9.png). \r\n\r\nAnother improvement is the exclusion from the group's results of simulations that have resulted in a footprint that is too large, i.e. over 100 tonnes. This limit will soon be configurable. \r\n\r\n## Technical improvements üêá\r\n\r\nWe're continuing to streamline the site, by removing a graphic animation library (react-spring) and better separating the conference mode from the rest of the application. \r\n\r\nOf course, many of the bugs reported have also been corrected.",

Walking üö∂‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è and other modes of transport are not forgotten, of course üõ¥.\r\n![Capture d‚Äô√©cran du 2021-02-08 15-42-24](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1177762/107234732-4097f700-6a24-11eb-9f54-ff64cf66183f.png)\r\n\r\nWe'll let you guess the impact of this quesiton on the results ;) \r\n\r\nWe've also improved the input guides (e.g. number of dwellings: with or without me?)\r\n\r\nü§≥ The phone question has been revised, now that all recent phones are over 5 inches, and to take into account the 'no smartphone' option.\r\n\r\nüî•üå≤ The question of heating in steres of wood becomes more relevant: it's counted in steres, not kWh. We'll be continuing to improve the other entries soon (wood pellets, fuel oil).\r\n\r\n## Other improvements \r\n\r\nNew features (like this one you're reading) now appear directly on https://nosgestesclimat.fr/nouveaut√©s, which is still more accessible than <a href=\"https://github.com/betagouv/ecolab-data/releases\">on github</a> üôÇ \r\n\r\n\r\nüêõ Several rather important bugs have been resolved thanks to your feedback (simulation end always at 11 tons, default value input -> no \"next\" button, etc.)\r\n\r\n## Our roadmap\r\n\r\nNow that the \"issues\" onget is clearer, it was time to put our simulator/calculation model roadmap online, in the <a href=\"https://github.com/betagouv/ecolab-data/projects/1\">\"Projects\" section</a>. It's all indicative, but it lets you know what we're currently working on. \r\n\r\n> As for the interface, this is the <a href=\"https://github.com/betagouv/ecolab-climat/milestones\">place</a> to go to follow our progress.",

This makes it particularly robust to changes, because we don't painstakingly order questions by hand, and we don't recode entanglements like \"if the user said he lived in an apartment, then don't ask him about the lawnmower\": everything is managed for us. \r\n\r\nThe management of \"mosaic\" questions (such as the \"heating\" checkboxes or the choice of lunch and dinner menus) has been improved, and now resides directly in <a href=\"https://github.com/datagir/nosgestesclimat-site/blob/master/docs/mosaic.md\">the model,</a> alongside the other questions! \r\n\r\nWhat's in it for us? It allows contributors who don't want to bother with Javascript (and other coding considerations) to modify the questions in an easy-to-use language. ",

This mode can be particularly useful in the context of a workshop or event, and a <a href=\"https://nosgestesclimat.fr/groupe/guide\">moderator's guide</a> is available to help you!\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55186402/171632300-dba6d437-a9bd-44b3-afc3-874c1e7307d6.png)\r\n\r\n* **Survey customization\r\nThe arrival of this new mode is accompanied by an additional feature that lets you add a few questions to gather additional information as an introduction to the test. By way of example, this can be useful for organizing an organization-wide survey while allowing results to be filtered by respondent type (status...), age, location (taking care, of course, not to compromise RGPD standards). We have also been working on survey security to prevent the introduction of vulnerabilities into our database via this feature. You'll find all the details in our <a href=\"https://nosgestesclimat.fr/groupe/documentation-contexte\">documentation</a>!\r\n\r\n<img width=\"800\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55186402/171632420-ada9f5c5-b1ab-45a5-b0f7-05d95df2b3bc.png\">\r\n\r\n* **Better filtering of the group mode view page\r\nIn the previous version, any user who logged in to the survey appeared in the visualization graph. This meant that some people counted as 1 participant without even having taken the test (with a score corresponding to the default values), and ghost visits distorted the results (especially the mean value!). This is no longer the case in this version, since the data displayed is filtered to exclude users who have completed less than 10% of the test questions. If the survey is customized (see above), an additional filter is applied to display only those participants who have completed the context questions.\r\n\r\n## A new metric: oil! üõ¢\r\nTo better visualize the amount of oil we consume in our lives, we've decided to add to Nos Gestes Climat the corresponding number of full tanks, in addition to CO‚ÇÇe. For the moment, this metric relates only to direct oil-related emissions (travel, oil heating ...). \r\nThe way both to highlight our dependence on these fossil fuels and to better visualize the impact of the actions we can put in place: the number of trips to the pump speaks louder than tons of CO‚ÇÇe, so swipe on the end screen to see your oil impact!\r\n\r\n<img width=\"577\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55186402/171646402-b2d769d1-0626-4a0d-8903-90b7727383e0.png\">\r\n\r\n## Calculation model improvements üßÆ\r\n* **Caravan & motorhome added**\r\nThere's now more choice in Nos Gestes Climat for your vacations! Caravans and motorhomes have found their place. Please note that for caravans, the number of kilometers traveled must be included in the kilometers traveled by car. More on methodology in issue #1317.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1177762/160854704-aa5b1010-e8f9-43cb-966b-ba80e6a8f731.png)\r\n\r\n* **Change in passenger ratio\r\nWith the arrival of the km entry aid in <a href=\"https://nosgestesclimat.fr/nouveaut%C3%A9s/las-n%C3%A9ous\">the latest release</a>, a question remained as to the choice of vehicle fill rate applied to attribute depreciation to the various car users. The details are available in issue #1337 and in the <a href=\"https://github.com/datagir/nosgestesclimat/blob/8fe4b633502fe52dda7eccdc0e9db01b9f677e57/data/transport/transport%20.%20voiture.yaml#L53\">note on the \"passenger ratio\" variable</a>. \r\n\r\n* **More choice of fuels\r\nDiesel (B7 or B10), gasoline (E5 or E10) or E85 gasoline (biofuels), you can choose! Beware, however, of the message sent to users when they select biofuels. The carbon impact is certainly lower, but the emission factor is particularly uncertain: land-use issues in particular are not taken into account!

This is in line with our strategy of opening up to audiences not yet aware of these subjects.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/i/status/1488059482647236608\">The Ministry of the Environment provides a demo here</a>. \r\n\r\n## Local, seasonal food üåª üöõ\r\n\r\nBased on Agribalyse, we have developed climate footprint variation models corresponding to seasonal and local diets. \r\n\r\n![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1177762/140048614-299fc659-6c87-441c-ab91-4b79e7c44b11.gif)\r\n\r\nTo the best of our knowledge, these improvements are unprecedented! As you can see, these \"options\" have little influence if your diet is not already strongly vegetarian. \r\n\r\n## New screen to help you enter kilometers by car ‚å®Ô∏è üõ£Ô∏è\r\n\r\nYou may have noticed that the question \"How many kilometers do you drive each year?\" is difficult to answer in one go. \r\n\r\nSo have we, and we've designed a form to help you do just that. \r\n\r\ncar km input help - demo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1177762/151338682-c79c82d3-4582-4981-98ab-401dc8c81206.gif)\r\n\r\nA big bonus: this form also eliminates the need to estimate a vehicle's fill rate, a task which is usually very risky. \r\n\r\n## Improvements to the \"action\" section üéØ\r\n\r\n- two new actions to switch to seasonal and local foods\r\n- we've improved the housing temperature reduction action: we now ask you for your current temperature\r\n- a new action to become vegan\r\n- we've separated the actions into different ranges, from \"more than a ton\" to \"less than 10kg\", and finally to \"unquantified actions\". \r\n\r\n## Gas price üî•\r\n\r\nYou've probably seen it before: gas prices are skyrocketing in France. Between +40% and +110% in just a few months. So we've revised upwards our tool for estimating kWh from ‚Ç¨/month. \r\n\r\nTo do this, we've reimplemented the regulated rate gas bill, including the various taxes and subscriptions that affect this figure.\r\n\r\n## New profile page\r\n\r\nA small button appears on the home page, indicating that you already have data on nosgestesclimat.fr. As before, we don't store any data on our servers; everything is stored locally on your browser. \r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1177762/151852468-1e9d0cf1-a19e-4540-8c9a-2bf9beb0c6da.png)\r\n\r\nAbove all, the profile page has been revamped, and it's now much easier to navigate through your answers. \r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1177762/151852657-f06c1d34-fc05-4c4a-8d23-8304cacfc4ea.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Ecodesign üèãÔ∏è\r\n\r\n*Let's keep in mind that the footprint of a website's service and use in France is very small, and generally already naturally optimized by developers. The environmental impact of digital technology is essentially linked to manufacturing <a href=\"https://librairie.ademe.fr/cadic/5311/infographie-preferer-smartphone-reconditionne.pdf?modal=false\">(70% for a smartphone, for example)</a>\r\n\r\n### Small screens \r\n\r\nWe're continuing our work to support small screens. \r\n\r\nHere are the improvements on iPhone5 SE. \r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1177762/144875622-2991b5a6-69c9-4c04-9422-48c727cc81af.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1177762/144875673-c96e2098-22bb-4e71-b993-3c121fd008a6.png)\r\n\r\nIn particular, we've optimized the footprint distribution graph, integrating text into the bars. It has also been animated, which makes it much easier to understand the impact of choices made during input. \r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1177762/151852263-5fb7fe31-e13e-4ce5-96a8-4794d19f5ce7.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Site hosting\r\n\r\nWe've <a href=\"https://answers.netlify.com/t/low-carbon-european-cdn/48784\">asked</a> our hosting provider (Netlify) if it would be possible for them to implement a server in France so that our users can see their site served from France, rather than from Germany at present. \r\n\r\n## Coming in 2022\r\n\r\nSee our roadmap for the calculation model <a href=\"https://github.com/datagir/nosgestesclimat/projects/1\">here</a>. \r\n\r\n\r\n",

		"body": "![it's at the National Assembly in the 7th arrondissement of Paris that the State budget is voted each year](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1177762/205978955-88a0ad61-244c-4afb-89a9-600eef3a5f1c.jpg)\r\n\r\nIf you've ever done a carbon footprint test, you may have noticed a rather surprising category: public services. Approximately 1 tonne out of the French average 10 tonnes of CO‚ÇÇ‚Çë in order of magnitude, this may not seem like much.... Only, for those who adopt a rather low-carbon lifestyle, and more generally in relation to the 2-tonne individual footprint target (remember that the important thing is not the target but the <a href=\"https://datagir.ademe.fr/blog/budget-empreinte-carbone-c-est-quoi/\">transition scenario</a>), 1 tonne can legitimately look like an elephant in the room! \r\n\r\nIn this article, we tell you all about this famous \"public services\" or now \"societal services\" item in NGC: how it's calculated, what it's made up of, and how we've just used these figures to make a **‚ú® new version of the nosgestesclimat.fr** calculation model. \r\n\r\n## The average French person emits 8.9 tons (November 2022)\r\n\r\nFrance, like many other countries, has set commitments to reduce its climate footprint and has defined <a href=\"https://www.ecologie.gouv.fr/strategie-nationale-bas-carbone-snbc\">a strategy</a> to achieve this.  \r\n\r\nTo get there, we obviously need to know *where we are* today and how things are evolving each year. \r\n\r\nThis is the task of the French Ministry of Ecology's <a href=\"https://www.statistiques.developpement-durable.gouv.fr/\">Service des donn√©es et √©tudes statistiques</a>, which <a href=\"https://www.statistiques.developpement-durable.gouv.fr/lempreinte-carbone-de-la-france-de-1995-2021?rubrique=27&dossier=1286\">estimates that our climate footprint will be 8.9 tonnes per person in 2021</a>. \r\n\r\nHow is this figure calculated? The calculation method is <a href=\"https://github.com/datagir/nosgestesclimat-site/files/9980633/methodologie_empreinte_carbone_octobre2021_0.pdf\">clever and transparent, but relatively difficult to understand</a>, so we'll try to explain it more simply here.\r\n\r\nBasically, to calculate a climate footprint, you need to start from a physical reality. We have to calculate the actual greenhouse gas emissions (well, estimate it) of a concrete action: for example we know that burning 1 liter of gasoline in a car emits around <a href=\"https://nosgestesclimat.fr/documentation/transport/voiture/thermique/empreinte-au-litre\">2.7 kg of CO‚ÇÇ‚Çë</a>. Then we can count the liters of diesel burned by French semi-trailers, by barges on rivers, by boats, planes and so on. \r\n\r\nThe problem, then, is to derive the footprint of other sectors, which don't burn these fossil fuels directly. For example, a hospital buys wooden furniture but does not manufacture or transport it itself. The furniture is cut in a factory, which purchased it. To do this, a truck delivered planks of wood. This wood has been treated by the chemical industry, and produced by the forestry sector (wood management), which uses diesel chainsaws, etc. \r\n\r\nThe administration doesn't have a precise description of all these transactions (kg of wood, volume of oil and paint, etc.), but it does have the exchanges in ‚Ç¨ between all these sectors, at an aggregated level over the year, which we call macro. Thanks to these monetary exchanges, a matrix calculation can be used to assign each sector the carbon footprint of its added value!\r\n\r\nIn simple terms: we obtain an estimate of greenhouse gas emissions according to which sector bought from which other sector. Returning to our hospital example, we can therefore estimate the carbon footprint of the healthcare sector, even if the exact details of each hospital's consumption are not known.\r\n\r\nThese calculations are made periodically. The latest accurate version is for 2017, and the latest (less accurate) estimate is for 2021. \r\n\r\n## Define the perimeter of a base allocated to each French person\r\n\r\nSumming up the footprint of all these sectors, divided by the country's population, gives <a href=\"https://nosgestesclimat.fr/documentation/empreinte-SDES\">the</a> so-called \"macro\" <a href=\"https://nosgestesclimat.fr/documentation/empreinte-SDES\">footprint</a> per person. \r\n\r\nIn parallel, the nosgestesclimat calculation model is a compilation of so-called \"micro\" models: you are asked a multitude of questions to reconstruct *your carbon footprint* from physical consumption data.\r\n\r\n> These are two perspectives on the same physical reality, two very different methods producing two figures, which fortunately converge around 9 tonnes of CO‚ÇÇ‚Çë. \r\n\r\nThe two methods are very different, but complementary for all that: indeed, analysis by consumption cannot capture all the emissions of a French person. While the nosgestesclimat micro method can easily calculate the footprint of your car mileage, it is incapable of estimating the footprint of the public services you use on a diffuse basis all year round, as well as commercial services such as the fiber and mobile internet network, which most of the population enjoy (albeit to varying degrees) on a latent basis. We therefore need to adopt a hybrid model, mixing micro and macro.\r\n\r\n> It's easy to estimate the climate footprint of a truck, car or motorcycle. But what about the footprint of this regularly repaved road? The maintenance of road signs? The footprint of the National Assembly itself? \r\n\r\nThe aim is to define the perimeter of these complementary worlds to avoid double counting, and thus obtain the final value of the constant societal services, the sum of public services and commercial services, attributed to each French citizen.\r\n\r\n![Recording 2022-12-15 at 14 02 25](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1177762/207865812-a37bbe96-2acd-4f0b-b9b5-ed64e93597da.gif)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## A first calculation\r\n\r\nWe therefore analyzed the macro footprint data <a href=\"https://www.statistiques.developpement-durable.gouv.fr/la-decomposition-de-lempreinte-carbone-de-la-demande-finale-de-la-france-par-postes-de-consommation\">shared by SDES</a>, sector by sector, line by line, to include a share, from 0 to 100%, of the societal services footprint. \r\n\r\n> It should be remembered that the aim is always to **obtain orders of magnitude**: it is not a question of claiming a result to the nearest ten kg of CO2. In this respect, it should be remembered that our climate objectives target a 90% reduction in our footprint. \r\n\r\nThe \"Public administration and defense\" line obviously includes 100% of public services as a matter of course: citizens have no influence on these sovereign positions other than through their vote and public commitment. The same applies to the \"Education\" line. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, things are more complicated for the \"üèóÔ∏è construction\" line: it includes many different activities that benefit society as a whole, but we don't have details of their carbon footprint. An allocation is therefore made on the basis of the sales of the sub-branches and sub-sub-branches <a href=\"https://www.insee.fr/fr/statistiques/4226067?sommaire=4226092\">published by INSEE</a>, and these are the % figures you can see in our documentation. \r\n\r<details>\n\r\n\r\n<summary><i>Find out more about the breakdown by sales of SDES carbon data</i></summary>\r\n\r\n> The data provided by SDES gives a carbon footprint corresponding to what is consumed on French territory by economic branch (e.g.: E36 = water distribution network = 677 kTCO‚ÇÇ‚Çë) or by group of economic branches (e.g.: F41_43 = Construction = 54116 kTCO‚ÇÇ‚Çë). For this data, there is therefore a first level of aggregation, which we have chosen to disaggregate according to the <a href=\"https://www.insee.fr/fr/statistiques/4226067?sommaire=4226092\">branch's</a> share of sales in the grouping proposed by SDES (e.g. for F41_43, we have F41=25%, F42=13.5%, F43=61.5%)\r\n&gt\r\n> As some data are secret, we have assumed that they are also secret for the calculation of the national carbon footprint. In the absence of further information, we have chosen not to consider them in these decomposition calculations.\r\n&gt\r\n> To go even further, we sometimes needed a higher level of precision by looking at economic sub-branches. Indeed, if we take the example of E38 relating to waste collection, only sub-branches E3812 and E3822, concerning hazardous waste, were to be included in public services. We have therefore also used the breakdown by sales to highlight the carbon intensity associated with the sub-branches in question within E38.\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n\r\nAs far as market services are concerned, we have tried to include in the basic footprint consumption that is relatively universal (e.g., everyone has to take out home insurance) or that is not yet taken into account by our micro models (e.g., consumption of telecommunications services), but which may be one day. \r\n\r\nIf you're interested, you can explore our documentation explaining and justifying this allocation via the <a href=\"https://nosgestesclimat.fr/documentation/services-publics\">public services</a> and <a href=\"https://nosgestesclimat.netlify.app/documentation/services-marchands\">market services</a> pages. It's quite \"expert\", but we've done our best for a first version, and your feedback will be invaluable.\r\n\r\n## The result\r\n\r\nHere's a photograph of our hybrid model. \r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1177762/207576758-03cfbc96-a6a2-4817-a4cb-4c4562342783.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n‚ö†Ô∏è Please note that this graph does not represent a reliable average value for the climate footprint of a French person, <a href=\"https://www.statistiques.developpement-durable.gouv.fr/lempreinte-carbone-de-la-france-de-1995-2021?rubrique=27&dossier=1286\">contrary to the SDES figure of 8.9t</a>, but simply the anatomy of our hybrid calculation model. Values are subject to regular change, in full transparency. \r\n\r\nThe aim of Nos Gestes Climat remains to estimate the footprint associated with a real person's lifestyle. In this respect, the aim of future versions is precisely to cover many items currently left out üêïÔ∏è‚õ¥Ô∏èüõµ‚ö°Ô∏èüè°. See you soon!",

If you've tried it out, you'll have noticed a few bugs and inconveniences. Fortunately, here's a first salvo of improvements for the new year. \r\n\r\n### Display of number of participants *and* number of completed tests\r\n\r\nIn group mode, we only displayed an indicator for the number of participants. But what about participants who are logged in but haven't finished or even started their test? \r\n\r\nWe now present two indicators: \r\n- the number of people connected (conference) or having registered their participation in the survey (survey)\r\n- the number of people who have completed their test, meaning they have answered at least 90% of the questions\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1177762/217204345-6c657130-7177-4229-bae3-b71e4dbebe97.png)\r\n\r\nThis change should make it much easier to welcome participants to a group session. It's up to you to tell us ;-)\r\n\r\n### Simplified welcome on the survey link\r\n\r\nThe user's welcome on a survey link has been simplified: the \"Take the test\" button is no longer displayed on the same page as the \"Participate\" button, which must be clicked to take part in a survey. \r\n\r\n### üßÆ Better explanation of graphs and averages\r\n\r\nUsually during a conference or survey, a moderator is there to explain the visualization page to users. If this isn't the case, here's a minimum explanation.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1177762/217012881-e9e7a66b-1792-4073-8d50-f5aee5c6aadf.png)\r\n\r\n### üî° Simplified survey names\r\n\r\nWe no longer allow spaces in survey names to avoid typos. \r\n\r\nWe've also added a screen to guide the user trying to access a non-existent survey. \r\n\r\n> In the past, to launch a survey, all you had to do was connect to an address. Now, the organizer must first create a poll on the <a href=\"https://nosgestesclimat.fr/groupe\">group page</a>.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1177762/217201362-b12fd578-1ea5-40e0-b749-2081e3ba2bce.png)\r\n\r\n## Optimization & performance\r\n\r\n### Reduced size of template loaded from site\r\n\r\nWe've greatly reduced the size of the calculation model loaded from the site: it's now **2 times lighter** ü™∂. \r\n\r\n<!-- Concr√®tement, pour calculer l<a href=\"https://nosgestesclimat.fr/documentation/alimentation/d√©chets/niveau-moyen\">empreinte carbone de vos d√©chets</a>, nous disposons d'un mod√®le de calcul sophistiqu√© d'un millier de lignes, enti√®rement expliqu√©. Auparavant, il √©tait t√©l√©charg√© int√©gralement par votre navigateur. Aujourd'hui, seul le r√©sultat final du calcul le sera ! \r\n-->\r\n\r\n> <details> <summary>More technical info on this reduction here</summary>\r\n&gt \r\n> We have developed a <a href=\"https://github.com/datagir/publiopti\">new</a> compression <a href=\"https://github.com/datagir/publiopti\">tool</a> for our calculation model. \r\n&gt \r\n> Indeed, in the interests of transparency and explicability, we try to be as precise and complete as possible when writing new models: this requires a breakdown into sub-rules and the creation of a (very thick) tree. This is the case for calculating<a href=\"https://nosgestesclimat.fr/documentation/alimentation/d√©chets/niveau-moyen\">the footprint of waste</a>, for example. While this complexity is necessary to understand the calculation, it is not necessary to execute it. \r\n&gt \r\n> This new tool therefore makes it possible to transform all the sub-branches of a calculation into a single value when this does not depend on the user's answers. This is the case for waste, but also for societal services, whose footprint is the same for every French person.\r\n&gt \r\n&gt </details>\r\n\r\nBut why download the calculation to your browser rather than to our servers like other sites? There are two main reasons: \r\n- nosgestesclimat.fr respects your privacy as much as possible: we don't **collect** your precious information (car kilometers, diet, m¬≤, etc...) ;\r\n- once the test is loaded, you use it like a mobile application: no need for an internet connection to answer the dozens of test questions.\r\n\r\n### Faster documentation pages & various site improvements\r\n\r\nIn the same vein as reducing the weight of the calculation model, we've reduced the initial loading time of the <a href=\"https://nosgestesclimat.fr/documentation\">model's documentation pages</a>, which allow anyone to explore the entire individual carbon footprint calculation. The calculation is now loaded in a \"lazy\" way, only at the click of a button, to display basic information more quickly. <a href=\"https://github.com/datagir/nosgestesclimat-site/pull/778\">More info here</a>.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the same time, we've reduced the weight of other pages, and added a loading indicator that evokes the new Nos Gestes Climat logo.\r\n\r\n![Nouvelle animation de chargement](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1177762/216140755-3c81d0e7-6cc2-4d56-82e3-9b851e9615ba.gif)\r\n\r\nA footer now allows you to consult the `About`, `Documentation` pages and even this `News` section from the rest of the site on desktop. \r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1177762/220296173-d8b2a9a7-320e-4437-9e00-ff7d5e31caed.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n## üë§ Improved /profile page\r\n\r\nAlthough we don't offer a logged-in user account, your <a href=\"https://nosgestesclimat.fr/profil\">profile page</a> stores your simulation data until you delete \"your cookies\". \r\n\r\nWe've improved it, with a button to unfold all test responses. This also enables reusers of our calculation model to list the questions asked by Nos Gestes Climat. \r\n\r\n![Recording 2023-02-21 at 09 51 35](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1177762/220295631-3fe9a9d9-81f1-45cd-a2fa-a19c8584d7f0.gif)\r\n\r\n> üí° Tip: we haven't yet publicly released our <a href=\"https://nosgestesclimat.fr/personas\">personas page</a>, which allows you to view the site as one of 9 typical users, from a 3-tonne score to a 16-tonne score. However, you can use it to explore our calculation model. More on this soon ;) \r\n\r\n## üè≥Ô∏è Internationalization\r\n\r\nWe've just released a more powerful version of our internationalization platform. It allows us to launch a beta version of a Swiss calculation model, but above all to facilitate the welcoming of new countries!\r\n\r\nAs far as possible, the question titles are no longer specific to France, particularly for <a href=\"https://github.com/datagir/nosgestesclimat/pull/1665\">the \"Airplane\" questions</a>. This allows us to make the test comprehensible to people from all over the world. On the other hand, the suggestions (\"a metropolitan flight\") remain linked to the test region for greater personalization. \r\n\r\nPlease note that these changes are only textual and do not affect emission factors.\r\n\r\n## üî† Translation\r\n\r\nTranslation scripts have been improved to better handle external contributions that would modify automatic translations <a href=\"https://github.com/datagir/nosgestesclimat/pull/1676\">for model translations</a> for the time being). \r\n\r\nThis will soon enable us to scale up to **translate Nos Gestes Climat into many languages**. \r\n\r\n## üßÆ Calculation model improvements\r\n\r\n### üèõÔ∏è More clarity on the societal services method\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://github.com/datagir/nosgestesclimat/tree/master/scripts/services-societaux\">The calculation scripts</a> that enabled us to release <a href=\"https://nosgestesclimat.fr/nouveaut%C3%A9s/l'empreinte-climat%20des%20%22services%20soci%C3%A9taux%22\">the latest version</a> have been improved, and a <a href=\"https://github.com/datagir/nosgestesclimat/wiki/Guide-technique-services-soci%C3%A9taux\">methodological guide</a> has been added to the <a href=\"https://github.com/datagir/nosgestesclimat/wiki\">wiki</a>. Bugs have been <a href=\"https://github.com/datagir/nosgestesclimat/pull/1638\">corrected</a>.\r\n\r\n### üìà‚Ç¨ Gas price update\r\n\r\nThe input help for switching from ‚Ç¨ to kWh for the annual gas consumption question <a href=\"https://github.com/datagir/nosgestesclimat/pull/1733\">is now up to date with the latest rates</a>! \r\n\r\n### üöó Correction of \"Car\" model\r\n\r\nWe have adjusted the scope of <a href=\"https://github.com/datagir/nosgestesclimat/pull/1704\">the emission factor linked to car manufacturing</a>. Indeed, in the first version of this model, we had chosen to subtract \"recycling credits\" corresponding to emissions avoided via the use of recycled materials from the dismantling of a car, for the production of new manufactured products. On reflection, we assume that the reduced footprint benefits the purchaser of the recycled product, and not the purchaser of a product destined for recycling. It's an assumption we've already applied to all NGC models!\r\n\r\n## Bug corrections\r\n\r\nSimulation graphics were mistakenly frozen during testing; this has now been <a href=\"https://github.com/datagir/nosgestesclimat-site/pull/828\">corrected</a>. \r\n\r\nWe've also added a button that opens the detailed graph on click. \r\n\r\n![Recording 2023-02-21 at 10 09 31](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1177762/220299822-c7eb9679-ca52-4bf9-a26c-bc1a4392f0c8.gif)\r\n \r\n ## ü•≥ External contributions\r\n\r\nWe're delighted with the increase in relevant external contributions. These include:\r\n- a <a href=\"https://github.com/datagir/nosgestesclimat-site/pull/835\">bug fixed</a> by <a href=\"https://github.com/mlbiche\">@mlbiche</a>,\r\n- many pertinent questions from <a href=\"https://github.com/marc-marc-marc\">@marc-marc-marc</a> and the rest of the community üôè,\r\n- a <a href=\"https://github.com/datagir/nosgestesclimat-site/issues/583\">Portuguese-language version of</a> the site thanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/micaelbatista\">@micaelbatista</a>. \r\n\r\nSee you soon! \r\n",

It is the second largest <a href=\"https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glacier\">glacier</a> in <a href=\"https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe\">Europe</a>.\r\n\r\n**In brief** :\r\n\r\n- ‚ú® New recruitments\r\n- üåç The test is now adapted for some fifteen new regions and countries\r\n- üßÆ Calculation model improved: pets, ferry, airplane, household appliances, furniture, heat networks, etc.\r\n- üë• Further improvements to group mode\r\n- üì± Improved display for small screens\r\n- ü™≤ Bug fixes\r\n\r\n## ‚ú® Recruitments\r\n\r\nWe're delighted to welcome 5 new people to the Nos Gestes Climat team, with the aim of scaling up in terms of disseminating and improving the tool:\r\n\r\n- Denis, developer\r\n- Margaux, deployment manager\r\n- J√©r√©mie, designer\r\n- Benjamin, Web developer\r\n- Julie, carbon model expert\r\n\r\n## üåç Internationalization of the calculation model\r\n\r\n### A new international home page\r\n\r\nDiscover our new homepage: *The<a href=\"https://nosgestesclimat.fr/international\">international climate footprint calculator</a>.**\r\n\r\n![Page d'accueil internationale](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1177762/234643345-39f53d27-e0f4-4a0a-881b-38a3985721e1.png)\r\n\r\n### 15 new countries and regions added\r\n\r\nMany new countries have been added to Nos Gestes Climat. Portugal, United Kingdom, Belgium, Italy, etc. \r\n\r\n\r\n![Mosa√Øque des pays](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1177762/234643447-50e4387d-e122-49a6-b7c0-c84399d08ccc.png)\r\n\r\nAre you comfortable with the subject of carbon, or are you motivated to contribute? There's plenty of scope for adding a new country or region. The principle is simple: write a set of differences between the carbon footprint of France, the basis of the model, and that of another region. \r\n\r\nAs an example, an external contributor himself proposed an extension for Tunisia, which we put online a week later. This was also the case for Guadeloupe, one of the first models to be added.\r\n\r\nIn particular, the electricity mix, regional specificities, customized emission factors if they exist, air flight recommendations (for example, Paris‚ÜíAthens could be replaced by Rome ‚Üí Tunis), etc. It's up to you! \r\n\r\nThanks to Electricity Map for allowing us to use the consumption mix data of the countries supported on NGC!\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://github.com/datagir/nosgestesclimat/pull/1732\">More technical info here.</a>\r\n\r\n## üßÆ Calculation model improvements\r\n\r\nOur calculation model is constantly being improved. We've pulled out all the stops this spring, with a host of much-requested new features.\r\n\r\n### More choice of furniture and appliances\r\n\r\nThe model for calculating the footprint of furnishings has been completed, with more choices and updated footprints. \r\n\r\n![Nouvel √©cran meubles](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1177762/234643519-9b9589b0-1bcd-49ba-b3d1-320ff377fbc9.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe same applies to household appliances. For example, if you've just moved house or remodeled your kitchen, this could be an opportunity to reassess your footprint.\r\n\r\n![Electrom√©nager](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1177762/234643708-4d3ff9ef-dafd-422f-981d-2eac7e782b67.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Pets\r\n\r\nOur little (and not so little) furry friends have joined Nos Gestes Climat with a new dedicated question! \r\n\r\n![Nouvelle question animaux domestiques](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1177762/234643987-533d60de-5c3b-4cdb-a687-0e432b17ff3f.png)\r\n\r\nIf you've got a dog or a cat, you know that you have to feed them. And food is an important part of our climate footprint. A golden opportunity to <a href=\"http://nosgestesclimat.fr/simulateur/bilan\">redo the test</a> and discover the impact of this footprint item. \r\n\r\n### Recording airplane hours over 3 years\r\n\r\nWe were well aware that <a href=\"https://github.com/datagir/nosgestesclimat/issues/1804\">for most French people (70%),</a> flying is a mode of travel that is not used every year.\r\n\r\nAs a result, many people who are concerned about global warming first decide to reduce their flights by spreading them out over time.\r\n\r\nWe've made the issue more flexible with a mini amortization calculator ‚ú®.\r\n\r\n![√âcran d'amortissement des heures d'avion](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1177762/234644247-67056d75-ff76-474f-b125-621e9126fdc3.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### The ferry\r\n\r\nMany of you asked us why ferry journeys, particularly to the many islands bordering France and its overseas territories, were not included in the test. \r\n\r\nThis is finally the case: by 2023, ferries will still be almost exclusively fossil-fuelled transport. The difficulty we had in adding this question was attributing the boat's footprint. This is because a ferry provides a wide range of transport services: in a cabin, in an armchair; with a car, with a caravan; freight transport, to supply the island or the mainland; on-board services such as restaurants and bars; variable-speed crossings; and so on.\r\n\r\n![Question ferry](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1177762/234644330-b0f1633f-648f-460c-92ce-6990465d6cda.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nTo avoid drowning you in questions, we've chosen an average passenger profile. We'll then take you through the details of a real ticket, as your ticket choices can change the footprint of your crossing completely, <a href=\"http://futur.eco/ferry\">as you can see on this dedicated mini-simulator</a>.\r\n\r\n### More choice of heating sources\r\n\r\nFor those lucky enough to already have their own heating system, we've added the option of a \"heat network\", a heating system that's set to become increasingly widespread thanks to the work of our friends at <a href=\"http://france-chaleur-urbaine.beta.gouv.fr/\">France Chaleur Urbaine</a>. \r\n\r\n![R√©seaux de chaleur](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1177762/234644422-20a6c82d-1b3e-44fa-9ca8-b009bab1bbab.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nWe've also thought about households with gas tanks üëçÔ∏è. \r\n\r\n### Various model improvements\r\n\r\nOn the transport front, statistical analysis has shown that many people use a Light Commercial Vehicle (LCV), also known as a \"van\", to get around in their personal lives. This is now an option for your car's size.\r\n\r\nTo help you, you can enter your heating oil consumption in ‚Ç¨ rather than kWh. But prices are changing! <a href=\"https://github.com/datagir/nosgestesclimat/pull/1741\">We've updated them.</a>\r\n\r\nSimilarly, the carbon footprint of **gas** has been <a href=\"https://github.com/datagir/nosgestesclimat/pull/1792\">updated</a>.\r\n\r\nIf a user entered \"zero\" to the questions \"number of inhabitants in the dwelling\" or \"number of car-poolers\", this would cause the site to crash, with the dreaded **division by zero** üòì (even though these are undesirable answers). This has now been corrected!\r\n\r\n## üë• Group mode improvements\r\n\r\nNos Gestes Climat's <a href=\"http://nosgestesclimat.fr/groupe\">group mode</a> lets you test with others, whether in a small group of friends, a company, or at a conference with an interactive experience.\r\n\r\nHere are the improvements to this mode:\r\n\r\n- a new menu item lets you discover and access group mode from anywhere in the application\r\n- the menu is easier to navigate: the active tab is more prominently displayed\r\n- when you join a group session, a clearly visible group session bar appears at the top of the page on both mobile and desktop, allowing you to return to the group session page with a single click\r\n- after joining a group session, if you close the tab and reopen it, the session is still active: we store it in the browser's memory\r\n- my ability to view only completed tests on the group mode screen\r\n- a host of discreet improvements **to this increasingly popular mode**\r\n- üî≠ coming soon: a brand-new, more professional and less interactive group mode for actual surveys.\r\n\r\n## üì± Better management of small screens\r\n\r\nParticular attention continues to be paid to making the user experience fluid on small screen sizes. \r\n\r\nThis includes **simplifying the menu bar** :\r\n\r\n![Screen_Shot_2023-04-06_at_15 54 50](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1177762/234644562-f48479e1-d6b3-422b-afae-09039b402e0c.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd the **highlighting of home page buttons**: \r\n\r\n![Screen_Shot_2023-04-06_at_16 10 02](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1177762/234644593-50e57c58-96bb-4220-ae8c-9abc8a7a9415.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n**The display of questions in *mosaic* form has also been reworked along these lines**. For both *numeric* and *checkbox* questions: \r\n\r\n![Screen_Shot_2023-04-06_at_16 26 50](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1177762/234644637-6e350aed-2a39-48b1-afc4-d374379a90a4.png)\r\n\r\n![Screen_Shot_2023-04-06_at_16 34 22](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1177762/234644659-517987a7-8775-4aa3-b49c-726b65629cec.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## üîß Tech\r\n\r\n### Improved Publicodes programming language\r\n\r\nThe NGC calculation model is written in the <a href=\"https://publi.codes/\">Publicodes</a> programming language. The model is now several thousand lines of code long, so it's important for us to follow and participate in the development of the Publicodes project so that we can make the language evolve in the right direction for NGC.\r\n\r\nOver the last few weeks** we've been able to add a new <a href=\"https://publi.codes/docs/api/m%C3%A9canismes#moyenne\">average</a> mechanism to Publicodes** to make the calculations in the <a href=\"https://nosgestesclimat.fr/documentation/divers/ameublement/meubles\">Furnishings</a> sub-model more comprehensible, for example, by <a href=\"https://nosgestesclimat.fr/documentation/divers/ameublement/meubles/lit/empreinte\">calculating the bed's footprint</a>.\r\n\r\nIn addition, several greenhouse gas calculation models written in Publicodes exist outside the NGC model, such as <a href=\"https://futur.eco/\">futur.eco</a>. <a href=\"https://github.com/datagir/nosgestesclimat/pull/1794\"></a>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://github.com/datagir/nosgestesclimat/pull/1794\">Technical solutions</a> were therefore put in place to enable us to **reuse them without having to duplicate the code**. *This enabled us to integrate <a href=\"http://futur.eco/ferry\">futureco's ferry calculation model</a> into Nos Gestes Climat without reinventing the wheel!\r\n\r\n### Various improvements\r\n\r\nNos Gestes Climat now supports the storage of **several simulations** in the user profile. For the moment, it's not much use. But it's a building block for the future..\r\n\r\nEach time the calculation model is modified, we now track the evolution of the footprint of each <a href=\"http://nosgestesclimat.fr/personas\">typical person</a> encoded in NGC. In this way, if a significant and unexpected increase is observed, we can check for a potential error.\r\n\r\nTo reinforce the site's reliability, we have implemented : \r\n\r\n- automated tests (Cypress) that simulate a user in dozens of paths: no more blank pages!\r\n- automatic error tracking (Sentry), because no test is ever infallible: we'll know more easily when errors are triggered and which ones to correct first\r\n\r\nTranslation management of the site and template have been improved to make the experience smoother and less restrictive for language contributors, with the aim of facilitating the addition of new languages in the future.\r\n\r\n## ü™≤ Miscellaneous bugs\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/datagir/nosgestesclimat-site/pull/781\r\n- https://github.com/datagir/nosgestesclimat-site/pull/903\r\n- https://github.com/datagir/nosgestesclimat-site/pull/905\r\n- https://github.com/datagir/nosgestesclimat/pull/1802\r\n- https://github.com/datagir/nosgestesclimat-site/pull/893\r\n- https://github.com/datagir/nosgestesclimat-site/pull/849\r\n- https://github.com/datagir/nosgestesclimat-site/pull/851\r\n\r\nüí° As a reminder, all Nos Gestes Climat public service developments are made transparently on the Github platform, both on <a href=\"https://github.com/datagir/nosgestesclimat-site/\">the site side</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/datagir/nosgestesclimat\">on the calculation model side</a>.\r\n\r\nSee you soon for more great news!",
