## The reference simulator

With **over [a million tests completed](/stats)**, nosgestesclimat.fr
is the reference personal carbon footprint calculator.

## What is my climate footprint?

The climate is warming up because of human activities, that's a fact.
But what is our role in all this as citizens?

To estimate our own impact on global warming, it is common to calculate
_our personal carbon footprint_.

The principle is simple: for each activity (driving your car 10km,
eating a steak, heating your house with gas...), we count the greenhouse
gas emissions over its life cycle.

As you respond to questions, the weight of each sector (transport, food, housing,
etc.) is added to make up your personal carbon footprint, and then explained visually with three infographics.

## Acting on my footprint, right now

After a 10-minute test, the [action
pages](https://nosgestesclimat.fr/actions) allow you to prioritize
the means to reduce your footprint and distinguish
the actions with the least impact on the climate (replacing our light bulbs, turning off
our appliances on standby) from the most impactful ones (eating less meat,
electrifying our lifestyle...).

Of course, even though it is essential to measure the footprint of our
consumptions and to understand their magnitude in relation to the [climate
budget](https://nosgestesclimat.fr/blog/budget),
some improvements are outside of our personal control:
for example, if you're renting and the landlord refuses to insulate the building to reduce energy consumption.
